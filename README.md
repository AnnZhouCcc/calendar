### Elaboration on Creative Portion ###

We did 3 items for the Creative Portion.
* Tag: Users can tag an event with a particular category when adding and modifying event. In addition, users can enable or disable those tags in the calendar view.
* Share: Users can share their calendar with other existing users. Users can choose to view their own calendar or calendars shared with them at the side bar under Show the calendar of.
* Group: Users can create group. Users can add member to a particular group if the user himself is a member of that group. Users can create group events that display on calendars of other group members too.

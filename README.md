### Note on calendar functions ###

* After one registers an account, one must login as well.
* When modifying event, user must input all the information he/she wants for the event. the form would not be filled automatically
* Sometimes the website would fall into buggy situations when some functions like add/modify/delete event, share etc do not working properly. Please refresh and try again, they usually works.

### Elaboration on Creative Portion ###

We did 3 items for the Creative Portion.
* Tag: Users can tag an event with a particular category when adding and modifying event. In addition, users can enable or disable those tags in the calendar view.
* Share: Users can share their calendar with other existing users. Users can choose to view their own calendar or calendars shared with them at the side bar under "Show the calendar of".
* Group: Users can create group. Users can add member to a particular group if the user himself is a member of that group. Users can create group events that display on calendars of other group members too. User have to remeber the name of Group he/she is in inorder to add group Events. Note: when editing events user must enter the group name again to keep it as a group event, otherwise it would become a personal event.
